# 📦 Supply Chain Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing supply chain efficiency and customer service performance for a company planning to expand into two additional cities. A major issue identified is that key customers are not renewing annual contracts due to service problems, including late deliveries and incomplete orders.

The objective of this analysis is to assess **On-Time Delivery %, In Full Delivery %, and On-Time In Full (OTIF) %**, identify gaps, and provide insights to improve supply chain performance.

## 📊 Key Business Metrics
The dashboard covers essential supply chain KPIs:
- **Total Order Lines**  
- **Line Fill Rate (LIFR)**  
- **Volume Fill Rate (VOFR)**  
- **Total Orders**  
- **On-Time Delivery %**  
- **In-Full Delivery %**  
- **On-Time In Full (OTIF) %**  
- **On-Time Target, In-Full Target, OTIF Target**  

## 📂 Dataset Information
The analysis is based on multiple CSV datasets:
1. **Customers.csv** – Customer details and regions  
2. **Products.csv** – Product information and categories  
3. **Dates.csv** – Date reference table  
4. **Targets.csv** – OTIF target values  
5. **OrderLines.csv** – Detailed order line records  
6. **AggregateOrders.csv** – Aggregated order summary  

## 🎯 Deliverables & Insights
✔ **OTIF % Analysis** by City and Customer  
✔ **Comparison with Targets** for Performance Evaluation  
✔ **Fill Rate Analysis** – Identifying Issues with Partial Deliveries  
✔ **Customer Service Level** – Identifying Key Customers at Risk  
✔ **Conditional Formatting in Matrix Visual** for Target Gaps  
✔ **Drill-Down OTIF Performance Views** (Monthly → Weekly → Daily)  
✔ **Metric Switch Option** – Toggle between Key Metrics  
✔ **Product-Level Insights** using Line Fill Rate (LIFR) & Volume Fill Rate (VOFR)
